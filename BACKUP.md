  --file="/backup/db/hysio_full_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).backup"

# Encrypt backup file
gpg --cipher-algo AES256 --compress-algo 1 --s2k-mode 3 \
  --s2k-digest-algo SHA512 --s2k-count 65536 --symmetric \
  --output "/backup/db/hysio_full_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).backup.gpg" \
  "/backup/db/hysio_full_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).backup"

# Transaction log backup for point-in-time recovery
pg_basebackup -h localhost -U backup_user -D /backup/wal_archive \
  --wal-method=stream --write-recovery-conf
```

#### Redis Session Data

```bash
# Create Redis backup
redis-cli --rdb /backup/redis/redis_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).rdb

# Encrypt Redis backup
gpg --cipher-algo AES256 --symmetric \

```bash
# Stop PostgreSQL service
systemctl stop postgresql

# Restore base backup
rm -rf /var/lib/postgresql/data/*
tar -xzf /backup/basebackup/base_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz \
  -C /var/lib/postgresql/data/

# Configure recovery
cat > /var/lib/postgresql/data/recovery.conf << EOF
restore_command = 'cp /backup/wal_archive/%f %p'
recovery_target_time = '2024-01-15 14:30:00'
recovery_target_action = 'promote'
EOF

# Start PostgreSQL for recovery
systemctl start postgresql

# Monitor recovery progress
tail -f /var/log/postgresql/postgresql.log
```

#### Full Database Restore

```bash
# Decrypt backup file
gpg --decrypt /backup/db/hysio_full_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.backup.gpg > \
  /tmp/hysio_restore.backup

# Drop existing database (if needed)
dropdb -h localhost -U postgres hysio_production

# Create new database
createdb -h localhost -U postgres hysio_production

# Restore from backup
pg_restore -h localhost -U postgres -d hysio_production \
  --verbose --clean --if-exists /tmp/hysio_restore.backup

# Secure cleanup
shred -vfz -n 3 /tmp/hysio_restore.backup
```

### Application Recovery Procedures

systemctl stop hysio-app redis nginx

# Decrypt and restore application files
gpg --decrypt /backup/full/hysio_full_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz.gpg | \
  tar -xzf - -C /

# Restore database (see database recovery procedures above)

# Restore file permissions
chown -R hysio:hysio /app/
chmod -R 750 /app/config/
chmod 600 /app/.env.production

# Restart services
systemctl start redis
systemctl start postgresql
systemctl start hysio-app
systemctl start nginx

# Verify system functionality
curl -f https://localhost/health || echo "Health check failed"

## Monitoring and Testing

### Backup Monitoring

**Automated Monitoring Checks**
```bash
# Backup success monitoring script
#!/bin/bash
LATEST_BACKUP=$(ls -t /backup/db/*.backup.gpg | head -n1)
BACKUP_AGE=$(stat -c %Y "$LATEST_BACKUP")
CURRENT_TIME=$(date +%s)
AGE_HOURS=$(( (CURRENT_TIME - BACKUP_AGE) / 3600 ))

if [ $AGE_HOURS -gt 26 ]; then
    echo "CRITICAL: Last backup is $AGE_HOURS hours old"
    # Send alert to monitoring system
    curl -X POST "https://monitoring.hysio.com/alerts" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"alert":"backup_failure","severity":"critical","age_hours":'$AGE_HOURS'}'
fi
```

**Backup Integrity Verification**
```bash
# Daily backup integrity check
#!/bin/bash
for backup_file in /backup/db/*.backup.gpg; do
    if ! gpg --decrypt "$backup_file" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        echo "ERROR: Backup integrity check failed for $backup_file"
        # Alert monitoring system
    fi
done
```
