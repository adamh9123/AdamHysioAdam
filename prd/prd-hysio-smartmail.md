# Product Requirements Document: Hysio SmartMail

## Introduction/Overview

Hysio SmartMail is an AI-powered email composition module designed to eliminate the administrative burden of healthcare communication for physiotherapists and other healthcare professionals. As a core component of the Hysio ecosystem, SmartMail transforms the time-consuming process of crafting professional emails into a seamless, context-aware experience.

The primary problem SmartMail addresses is the significant time healthcare professionals spend on email communicationâ€”studies indicate that AI-generated emails can reduce email management time by approximately 30%. This administrative burden pulls practitioners away from patient care, creating inefficiencies in healthcare delivery.

**Goal**: Enable healthcare professionals to generate comprehensive, contextually appropriate, and professionally formatted emails in seconds rather than minutes, while maintaining clinical accuracy, professional tone, and regulatory compliance.

## Goals

1. **Time Reduction**: Reduce email composition time by 70% for healthcare professionals
2. **Professional Consistency**: Ensure all generated emails meet professional healthcare communication standards
3. **Context Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with Hysio Medical Scribe and other modules for context-aware email generation  
4. **Multi-Audience Support**: Support appropriate tone and content adaptation for colleagues, specialists, patients, and family members
5. **Document Intelligence**: Process and incorporate information from uploaded medical documents, transcripts, and reports
6. **Compliance Assurance**: Maintain HIPAA/GDPR compliance and healthcare regulatory standards
7. **Workflow Integration**: Integrate naturally into existing healthcare workflows without disruption
8. **Quality Improvement**: Enhance communication quality through AI-assisted professional language and structure

## User Stories

### Primary Healthcare Professional Stories

**As a physiotherapist**, I want to quickly generate a referral email to a specialist so that I can communicate my patient's condition and request appropriate follow-up care without spending 15 minutes crafting the message.

**As a healthcare professional**, I want to send a follow-up email to a patient's family after a consultation so that they understand the treatment plan and feel informed about their loved one's care.

**As a physiotherapist**, I want to request additional diagnostic information from a colleague so that I can make better treatment decisions for my patient.

**As a healthcare provider**, I want to send a professional update to a referring physician so that they understand the current status and progress of their referred patient.

### Secondary Stories

**As a healthcare professional**, I want to generate patient education emails so that my patients have written information to reference at home about their condition and exercises.

**As a practice manager**, I want standardized communication templates so that all staff members send consistent, professional emails regardless of their writing skills.

**As a multilingual healthcare provider**, I want to generate emails in different languages so that I can communicate effectively with diverse patient populations.
