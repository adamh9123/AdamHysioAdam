## What's NOT Included (By Design)

**Code Extraction**:
- Actual prompt file contents (too large, source is authoritative)
- Component source code (read directly from codebase)
- Full type definitions (reference `hysio/src/types/*.ts`)

**Rationale**: This is a **guide TO the codebase**, not a replacement. Critical information is documented, but you should read actual source files for implementation details.

**Reference Pattern**:
- Documentation: "The SOEP prompt is located at `hysio/src/lib/prompts/consult/stap1-verwerking-soep-verslag.ts` and implements v9.0 GOLDEN STANDARD..."
- Your Action: Open that file and read it with context from this documentation

---

## Next Steps After Reading

1. ✅ Read `00-START_HERE.md`
2. ✅ Set up development environment
3. ✅ Run one complete workflow
4. ✅ Read one AI prompt file (SOEP recommended)

### Short-term (Week 1)
1. Complete "First Week Action Plan" from `HANDOVER_SUMMARY.md`
2. Pick one "quick win" from `technical-debt.md` and implement it
3. Review CHANGELOG.md for recent changes
4. Meet with team to align on priorities

### Medium-term (Month 1)
1. Contribute to database layer implementation (P1)
2. Implement authentication system (P1)
