## Why These Files Are Archived

This directory contains documentation that has been **superseded** by improved versions. These files are kept for historical reference but should **NOT** be used for current work.

### Archived Files

#### AI_INTEGRATION_MASTER_GUIDE.md
- **Status**: ‚ùå DEPRECATED
- **Superseded By**: `guides/AI_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md`
- **Reason**: 98% duplicate content with COMPLETE_GUIDE
- **Archived Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Use Case**: Historical reference only

**Why superseded**: This was the first comprehensive guide created. It was later enhanced and renamed to AI_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md with additional sections on troubleshooting, optimization, and more detailed cost analysis. Keeping both created confusion about which was canonical.

#### ai-pipelines-overview.md
- **Status**: ‚ùå DEPRECATED
- **Superseded By**: `guides/AI_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md` (Section 2: AI Pipeline Architecture)
- **Reason**: Redundant subset of complete guide
- **Archived Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Use Case**: Historical reference only

**Why superseded**: This overview contained basic AI pipeline information that was fully integrated into Section 2 of the Complete Guide with more detail and better integration with other sections.
