# Product Vision: Hysio

## The "Why" Behind Hysio

### Mission Statement

**"An AI colleague, not a replacement, for Dutch physiotherapists."**

Hysio exists to give physiotherapists their time back by automating the most tedious part of their job: documentation. We're not replacing clinical judgment - we're eliminating documentation friction so therapists can focus on what they do best: healing patients.

### The Problem We're Solving

**The Documentation Burden:**
- Average physiotherapist spends **40-60 minutes per day** on documentation
- That's **20-30% of billable time** lost to admin work
- Documentation quality suffers when rushed
- Patient care suffers when therapists are burned out
- Compliance risks increase with poor documentation

**Why Traditional Solutions Fail:**
- Generic dictation tools don't understand physiotherapy
- Template-based systems are rigid and time-consuming
- Manual note-taking is error-prone and incomplete
- Voice-to-text transcription produces unusable raw text

**Hysio's Unique Solution:**
- **Context-aware AI** that understands Dutch physiotherapy frameworks (SOEP, HHSB, ICF)
- **Intelligent structuring** that transforms raw audio into professional documentation
- **Evidence-based** outputs that reference professional guidelines
- **Privacy-first** design with automatic anonymization
- **Declarabel** outputs that meet insurance requirements

### Product Philosophy

#### 1. AI Colleague, Not Replacement

Hysio **assists**, never **decides**:
- Suggests, never prescribes
- Structures, never invents
- Supports, never substitutes clinical judgment

The therapist is always in control. Every output is clearly marked as AI-generated and requires professional review.

#### 2. Empathetic, Efficient, Evidence-Based

**Empathetic:**
- Understands the therapist's workflow
- Respects patient dignity (automatic anonymization)
- Designed for real-world clinical scenarios, not ideal cases

**Efficient:**
- **70%+ time savings** on documentation
- **Sub-2-minute** processing time per document
- One-click export to EPD-ready formats

**Evidence-Based:**
- References professional guidelines (explicitly avoiding proprietary organization names per brand sovereignty policy)
- Follows SOEP/HHSB/ICF frameworks
- Integrates with latest research (where appropriate)

#### 3. Privacy & Compliance First

**Not an afterthought - a foundation:**
- **AVG/GDPR** compliant by design
- **NEN 7510/7512/7513** standards adherence
- **Automatic anonymization** of all PII/PHI
- **Zero-tolerance** for data fabrication (v7.0 Grounding Protocol)
- **Audit trails** for all AI decisions

### Core Beliefs

**What We Believe:**
1. **AI should augment humans, not replace them** - Especially in healthcare
2. **Privacy is not negotiable** - Patient data is sacred
3. **Quality over speed** - But we can have both with good engineering
4. **Evidence-based medicine** - AI must respect clinical guidelines
5. **Open communication** - Transparent about AI capabilities and limitations
6. **Continuous improvement** - AI models and prompts should evolve with usage
7. **Dutch healthcare first** - Deep localization, not shallow translation

**What We Don't Believe:**
1. ❌ AI can replace clinical judgment
2. ❌ One-size-fits-all solutions work in healthcare
3. ❌ Speed justifies compromising patient privacy
4. ❌ Healthcare professionals should adapt to software (software adapts to them)
5. ❌ "Good enough" documentation is acceptable
6. ❌ Proprietary black-box AI (we explain our reasoning)

### Clinical Frameworks Hysio Supports

**Documentation Standards:**
- **SOEP**: Subjectief, Objectief, Evaluatie, Plan (follow-up consultations)
- **HHSB**: Hulpvraag, Historie, Stoornissen, Beperkingen (intake anamnesis)

**Assessment Frameworks:**
- **LOFTIG**: Locatie, Ontstaan, Frequentie, Tijdsduur, Intensiteit, Geschiedenis (pain assessment)
- **SCEGS**: Goals assessment framework (patient objectives)
- **DTF**: Directe Toegang Fysiotherapie guidelines (red flags screening)

**Clinical Reasoning:**
- **Biopsychosocial Model**: Holistic patient assessment
- **Evidence-Based Practice (EBP)**: Research + expertise + patient values
- **Red Flags Detection**: Safety-first screening for serious pathology

### The Vision: 5 Years Out

- **Publish peer-reviewed research** validating AI clinical documentation
- **Achieve medical device certification** in EU (CE marking) and beyond

**The Ultimate Goal:**
Give every physiotherapist a world-class AI colleague that lets them focus on what they love: helping patients heal.

**Remember:**
- We're building for **therapists**, not for us
- Every feature must **save time** or **improve quality**
- **Privacy and compliance** are never compromised for convenience
- **Evidence-based** means we cite our sources
- **AI colleague** means the human is always in control
