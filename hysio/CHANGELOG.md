## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added comprehensive performance monitoring system with real-time health checks
- Added clinical accuracy validation test suite with realistic patient scenarios
- Added system health endpoint at `/api/health` with performance metrics and alerts
- Added comprehensive logging throughout transcription and AI processing pipelines
- Added performance metrics tracking for API response times and error rates
- Added support for context document integration across all Medical Scribe workflows
- Added automatic client-type detection for response optimization
- Added comprehensive integration test suite for Medical Scribe workflows
- Added validation for red flag detection in clinical scenarios (cauda equina syndrome)
- Added multi-format audio file support (MP3, WAV, M4A, WebM, OGG, FLAC) with validation
- Added 25MB file size limit with proper error handling for audio uploads
- Added detailed error diagnostics and recovery suggestions throughout the system

### Changed
- Refactored all Medical Scribe API endpoints to process real patient data instead of simulated content
- Optimized AI processing prompts for token efficiency (reduced max tokens from 2000 to 1500)
- Enhanced error handling across all workflows with graceful degradation and user-friendly messages
- Improved state management synchronization in Zustand store with persistence
- Updated transcription system to use client-side processing with Groq Whisper API
- Optimized response compression based on client device type for mobile performance
- Enhanced HHSB and SOEP structure parsing with improved regex patterns
- Improved audio transcription with comprehensive performance and confidence metrics
- Updated API caching system for better performance with repeated queries
- Enhanced context document processing for preparation generation integration

### Fixed
- Fixed critical issue where Medical Scribe workflows generated fake/simulated data instead of real patient information
- Fixed critical 400 Bad Request error in intake-stapsgewijs anamnese workflow by implementing proper client-side transcription
- Fixed Groq API transcription error handling with user-friendly fallback to manual entry
- Fixed data flow integrity ensuring audio/file inputs are properly transcribed before API processing
- Fixed HHSB processing route to reject raw audio input with clear error messages
- Fixed SOEP processing route to eliminate simulation logic and enforce real data processing
- Fixed TypeScript parameter issues in Next.js 15 dynamic route handlers
- Fixed syntax errors in API route files that prevented successful builds
- Fixed unused import warnings in diagnostic code routes
- Fixed audio transcription error handling to return proper error responses
- Fixed context document integration issues across all three Medical Scribe workflows
- Fixed state persistence issues with patient information and session data
- Fixed performance bottlenecks in AI processing pipeline
- Fixed clinical accuracy issues with proper HHSB methodology implementation

### Removed
- Removed all simulation and placeholder code from API endpoints that was generating fake transcripts
- Removed processAudioInput function that returned simulated patient data
- Removed hardcoded fake responses from HHSB and SOEP processing routes
- Removed deprecated error handling patterns in favor of comprehensive error boundaries
- Removed unused imports and dependencies that were causing build warnings
- Removed inefficient prompt engineering patterns that wasted AI tokens
- Removed legacy Jest test configurations in favor of Vitest setup
- Removed redundant validation logic that was duplicated across components
