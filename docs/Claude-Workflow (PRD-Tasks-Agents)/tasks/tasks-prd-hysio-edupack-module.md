### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `edupack-panel.tsx` and `edupack-panel.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
