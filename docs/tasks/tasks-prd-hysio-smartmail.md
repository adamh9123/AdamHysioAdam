### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing in the same directory
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration
- SmartMail leverages existing infrastructure: document-processor.ts, API patterns, UI components (Button, Card, CopyToClipboard), and Assistant integration
- Follow existing Hysio design patterns: Dutch language support, mint/deep-green color scheme, accessibility standards
